### Historical Map Georeferencing

I've been georeferencing historical maps for fun and for work for a number of
years. It is the focus of my current master's thesis research, specifically,
new ideas for how to best crowdsource the work for large institutional collections.

### Presentations

#### [GeoNode Summit 2020](https://summit.geonode.org/schedule/#session-110) - [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSwbTO3jKrwGFKwouZdPSWfQVB3sws8I7bdH_CiSoNTt3l3wefu3s50NAxXn4N7M9CkW09hf9xZh63j/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

In December 2020 I gave a presentation about crowdsourced georeferencing at
the GeoNode Summit virtual meeting. I outlined my MS thesis project to build
browser-based map georeferencing capabilities into GeoNode.

#### [QGIS North America 2020](http://qgis.us/qgis-na-2020) - [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsayFBVmMWvHRS6CLXnS0onRCX0S3N1rhZGWzsLLE-DnRhBHUTmn8wpBjSOtSVqdjVIzRLETLykv_a/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

In July 2020 I presented at the QGIS North America virtual meeting about how I use
GIMP to edit georeferenced historical maps.
