#### Hello ~

<!-- <div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9"> -->

I am a GIS specialist/developer, and often cartographer, who loves working with historical maps and open source software. My main tools are QGIS, Python, PostGIS, and Django.

I am currently a masters student at [Louisiana State University](https://lsu.edu) studying in both the Geography and Library Information Science departments.

I also have a consulting business, [Legion GIS](https://legiongis.com), through which I have worked extensively with the open source project [Arches](https://archesproject.org).

You can find my CV [here](pages/cv.html).

Thanks for looking, and feel free to get in touch: <a class="email-address-txt"></a>.
