<h4>Hi there.</h4> I'm a GIS specialist/developer, and often cartographer. This site serves as general portfolio and repository for my GIS and web-work that is not related to my real company, Legion GIS, LLC. Please check out the Legion website, [www.legiongis.com](http://legiongis.com), to get in contact with me for professional GIS services.

I've posted my curriculum vitae [here](pages/adam-c-f-cox.html), or you can see basically the same thing on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mradamcox?trk=hp-identity-name).

Thanks for looking, and feel free to get in touch
