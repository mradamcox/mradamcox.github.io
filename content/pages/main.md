# Hello ~

I am a GIS specialist/developer, and often cartographer, who loves working with historical maps and open source software. My main tools are QGIS, Python, PostGIS, and Django. This site is a continual work-in-progress, but I work on a lot of fun projects so I try to share about them here.

In summer of 2022 I completed MS Geography and MLIS degrees at Louisiana State University. My thesis, ["Creating a Public Space for Georeferencing Sanborn Maps: A Louisiana Case Study"](https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_theses/5641/) explored a crowdsourcing approach for content in the Library of Congress Sanborn maps collection. You can read a more about it on [the documentation site](https://about.oldinsurancemaps.net) or see the outcome on the project site: [oldinsurancemaps.net](https://oldinsurancemaps.net).

Currently, I work as a research software engineer in the Healthy Regions & Policies Lab, at the University of Illinois - Urbana-Chapmaign. I also have a mostly-inactive geospatial consulting business, [Legion GIS](https://legiongis.com), through which I have worked extensively with the open source project [Arches](https://archesproject.org).

Here are my almost-up-to-date [resume](pages/resume.html) and [CV](pages/cv.html).

Thanks for looking, and feel free to get in touch: <a class="email-address-txt"></a>.
