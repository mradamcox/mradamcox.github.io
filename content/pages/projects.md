<p style="text-align:center"><strong>~ Old Map Projects ~</strong></p>

I've been georeferencing historical maps for fun and for work for a number of years. Though the projects I've worked on are all over the place, and some no longer available online, I try to maintain and reuse the map layers here as well as possible.

## "QGIS and GIMP for Enhancing Historic Maps" ~ [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsayFBVmMWvHRS6CLXnS0onRCX0S3N1rhZGWzsLLE-DnRhBHUTmn8wpBjSOtSVqdjVIzRLETLykv_a/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) ~ [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1G0qyETCow&feature=youtu.be)

In July 2020 I presented at the QGIS North America virtual meeting about how I use
GIMP to edit georeferenced historical maps.

## "New Techniques for Old Maps" ~ [notebook collection](https://observablehq.com/collection/@mradamcox/a-break-from-the-past)

For a digital humanities course in fall 2019, I made this collection of Observable notebooks to illustrate some new ideas and techniques I like to use with historical maps on the web.

## Armed Forces Retirement Home, Washington, D.C. ~ [web map](/maps/afrh_historicmaps.html)

This was a staging ground for 2015 work I did on the Armed Forces Retirement Home implementation of Arches ([afrh-iris.com](https://afrh-iris.com)).

## Natchitoches Parish, LA ~ [web map](/maps/natchitoches_parish.html) ~ [notebook](https://observablehq.com/@mradamcox/northwest-louisiana-historic-maps?collection=@mradamcox/web-maps)

View the many historic map overlays and custom basemaps that I created for the Cane River Heritage Inventory & Map, which is no longer maintained. These included scans of "Captured Confederate Maps"
I obtained through the National Archives (see the notebook above for more information).

## Vernon County, WI ~ [web map](/maps/vernon_county.html)

This web map features two special layers related to Vernon County: a 1967 US Army Corps of Engineers map of the Kickapoo Valley Reserve and a LiDAR-derived relief basemap that I made in TileMill.

## Cane River Memories Interviews ~ [audio](/pages/cane-river-memories-interviews.html)

I worked with these recordings a bit for the Cane River Heritage Inventory & Map,
and I've left them available here for the time being, as that project is no longer
maintained.

        <h2>Web Maps in Observable Notebooks</h2>
      <p>I use Observable a lot to create web maps--sometimes to share ideas, other times to just test out new layers.</p>
