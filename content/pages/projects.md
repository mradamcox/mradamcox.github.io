### [Historical Map Georeferencing](/pages/georeferencing.html)

My current thesis research is based around georeferencing historical maps in a
collaborative, crowdsourced environment.

### Web Maps

#### [Observable Notebooks](https://observablehq.com/collection/@mradamcox/web-maps)

I use Observable a lot to create web maps--sometimes to share ideas, other times to just
test out new layers.

#### [Natchitoches Parish Historic Maps](/maps/natchitoches_parish.html)

This was a testing ground for the historic map overlays and extra basemaps that I included in the Cane River Heritage Inventory & Map.

#### [Vernon County](/maps/vernon_county.html)

This map features a two special layers related to Vernon County: a 1967 US Army Corps of Engineers map of Kickapoo Valley Reserve and a LiDAR-derived relief basemap.

#### [AFRH Historic Maps](/maps/afrh_historicmaps.html)

Staging ground for 2015 work on Armed Forces Retirement Home historic map overlays.  These will be used in the new Arches installation for the AFRH.
