# Crowdsourced Georeferencing Old Insurance Maps

### [oldinsurancemaps.net &rarr;](https://oldinsurancemaps.net)

## Project Background

For my Geography M.S. thesis at Louisiana State University I have put together an open platform that allows anyone to georeference historical fire insurance maps that are held in the Library of Congress [digital Sanborn collection](https://loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps). There are over 500,000 scanned documents in this collection, which cover 10,000+ communities in the US. 

The goal of this project is to create a space in which the public can help transform scanned
maps into more reusable spatial layers, while also facilitating engagement with those maps.
For the beta release, only maps of cities in Louisiana are available.
