            <p>I've been reworking the structure of this site a bit, mostly just in how it is built and deployed (surely not adding any interesting content...), and mostly just for "fun". Just a quick post here to record two updates I've made over the last couple of weeks in quick succession.</p>
<h2>Getting Rid of the Output Submodule</h2>
<p>A <a href="/moving-to-pelican-and-github-pages.html">long time ago</a>, I set this site up as two separate repos, one called <code>mradamcox.github.io-src</code> and another, which was setup as a submodule inside the first, called <code>mradamcox.github.io</code>. The structure was such that running <code>pelican content</code> in the <code>-src</code> repo would build the site directly into the submodule, which, as a separate repo with GitHub pages enabled, would automatically get built and deployed.</p>
<p>Recently, however, I learned that GitHub pages can now build from a top-level <code>docs</code> directory in your repo, where before it would only build from the root directory. This meant that I was able to completely get rid of the submodule (no one really likes those anyway) and delete that repo, rename the source repo to remove <code>-src</code> from the end, and then update the <code>pelicanconf.py</code> file to output the build to a <code>./docs</code> directory.</p>
<p>After that, running <code>pelican content</code> would build the site directly into <code>docs</code>, and then <code>git commit -s docs -m "rebuild site" &amp;&amp; git push</code> would update the code on GitHub and trigger the Pages deployment.</p>
<h2>Using GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>However, just today I was looking a bit further into Pelican for a work project, and found <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/2993">this ticket</a> about automatic deployment with GitHub Actions. The benefit of this, I realized, is that you don't need to have a local clone that you build and then commit and push... Editing a single markdown file directly in GitHub would trigger an update on the live website.</p>
<p>The ticket points to this GitHub Action, <a href="https://github.com/rehanhaider/pelican-to-github-pages">rehanhaider/pelican-to-github-pages</a>, and here it is in the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pelican-to-github-pages">GitHub actions marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>I followed the simple deployment steps, leaving out the <code>CNAME</code> setting as I don't have one for this site at this time, so my <code>.github/workflows/pelican.yml</code> file looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Deploy</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>While this did immediately build the content using the settings in <code>publishconf.py</code> every time a push event hit the <code>master</code> branch, it wasn't yet deploying to the public pages website.</p>
<p>In the repo Settings, I realized GitHub pages was still trying to build off of the <code>./docs</code> directory in the master branch, but the new Action wasn't actually committing anything to that directory. Judging from the logs, it was actually committing and pushing the build to a new <code>gh-pages</code> branch (which I hadn't used at all in this repo yet), so I switch the GitHub Pages configuration to build from the root of that branch, and it worked as a charm.</p>
<hr>
<p>One thing I found a little confusing at first is that GitHub Pages is listed as an Action in the repo already, so now there are two actions: 1) the one I just added, which runs on every push to <code>master</code>, and finishes by pushing to <code>gh-pages</code>, and 2) the default GitHub Pages action which, now, is triggered on any push to <code>gh-pages</code>, and finishes by publishing that content to this site.</p>
<p>Maybe this setup will last another seven years...</p>
